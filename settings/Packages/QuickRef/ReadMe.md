Overview
--------

QuickRef lets you keep track of every key binding you can think of, anytime and anywhere from a convenient command pallette. You can customize the bahavious in a multitude of ways and include commands that are not in the default keymap, or you simply go with that Sublime Text provides for you.

Usage
-----

#### Basic
* Use a keyboard shortcut (eg. `alt+p` on Windows) to bring up the QuickRef command palette.
* All commands are searchable.
* Selecting a command will execute it.

#### Adding commands
1. Pick your favourite (or hardest to memorize) commands from any ".sublime-keymap" file (or write your own).
2. Add as many as you like to the *user* settings file. Make sure that both the commands and the settings file in general are formatted correctly (see default settings file)!
3. Add a caption (optional).
4. Optionally add more key bindings from the user/default key bindings files.

#### Adding favourites
1. Use a keyboard shortcut (eg. `alt+shift+p` on Windows) to bring up the QuickRef command palette in add/remove favourites mode.
2. Simply select the command you want to mark and immediately see it get moved to the top of the list and pefixed with a (*).

Features
--------

#### Hardcore mode
Hardcore mode will not allow you to run any commands from the command palette, thus forcing you to remember them instead.

#### Sort alphabetically
Sort commands alphabetically or in the order that they are added to the settings file.

#### Beautify captions
Beautify captions. E.g.: "clear_fields" -> "Clear fields". Great for users who don't want to add captions manually.
