ST2-Backbone.Marionette
=======================

## [Backbone.Marionette](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/) snippets and tab completions for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
----  
*updated: Nov 28, 2012*
  
This package for Sublime Text 2 adds snippets for the [Backbone.Marionette](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/) library.  

The Backbone.Marionette package makes a great companion to Tomasz Tunik's [Backbone.js ST2 package](https://github.com/tomasztunik/Sublime-Text-2-Backbone.js-package) and borrows heavily from it as well.

--------    
	+ completions for Backbone.Marionette version 1.0.0-beta
    + support for JavaScript and CoffeScript
    + some basic snippets (not thouroughly tested)

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is using [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). Updates are applied automatically if using this method.

If Sublime Package Control isn't your thing you can clone this repository into your ST2 packages directory.
  
`git clone https://github.com/amokan/ST2-Backbone.Marionette`

Issues/Pull Requests
--------------------

This was a quick effort to get completions added for my own personal use. I created some snippets after looking into the Backbone.js ST2 package. 
  
To be honest, I rarely use snippets so I know they are lacking here. 
  
If you have any issues or want to complain about things I haven't added yet - drop me a line or submit a pull request. If you submit a pull request with a new snippet, please update this README with the shortcut(s).
  
Thank you.
